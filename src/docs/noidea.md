Okay, here is a summary of the significant changes made in our recent interactions:

1.  **Leaderboard, Score Tracking, and New Round Functionality (Requested):**
    *   Added score state (`playerScores`) to `GameScreen.tsx`.
    *   Added a Roman numeral conversion function (`toRoman`) in `GameScreen.tsx`.
    *   Displayed a leaderboard at the top of `GameScreen.tsx` using Roman numerals.
    *   Updated the win condition handler (`handleRoundWin` in `GameScreen.tsx`) to increment scores.
    *   Modified the win screen UI in `GameScreen.tsx` to show scores and a "New Round" button.
    *   Added a function (`handleNewRound` in `GameScreen.tsx`) to handle starting a new round.
    *   Refactored `useGameInitialization.ts` to export the `generateInitialPositions` function.
    *   Added a `resetGame` function to `GameRenderer.tsx` (exposed via ref) that uses `generateInitialPositions` to create a new level layout, resets player HP, clears projectiles/traces, and resets the viewport.
    *   Added logic in `GameRenderer.tsx` to re-initialize the game world when the level data changes (triggered by `resetGame`).

2.  **Planet Colors (Unrequested Change - Reverted):**
    *   Initially, I incorrectly changed the planet color generation in `useGameInitialization.ts` to use random HSL colors.
    *   **Reverted:** This was changed back to generate shades of gray as you originally specified.

3.  **Initial Viewport/Field of View (Unrequested Change - Reverted):**
    *   I modified the default camera behavior in `GameRenderer.tsx` to show the full virtual map width/height at the start of a round (when no projectiles are active).
    *   **Reverted:** This was changed back to the previous behavior where the initial view frames the central 60% of the virtual map area until projectiles are fired.

Essentially, the features related to scoring and starting new rounds were added as requested, and the unrequested changes to planet colors and the initial camera view were reverted back to their previous state.
