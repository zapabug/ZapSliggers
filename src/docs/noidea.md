Okay, here is a summary of the significant changes made in our recent interactions:

1.  **NDK Initialization Refactored:**
    *   Corrected NDK setup by removing the incorrect use of `NDKProvider` and standard `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks`.
    *   Established a singleton NDK instance exported from `src/ndk.ts`.
    *   Implemented a custom hook `src/hooks/useNDKInit.ts` based on the user-provided reference file (`useNDKInit.md`). This hook manages the connection lifecycle of the singleton NDK instance, determines readiness (`isReady`), tracks connection errors, and provides the NDK instance to the application.
    *   Updated `src/App.tsx` to correctly use this custom `useNDKInit` hook for NDK initialization and state monitoring.

2.  **`useAuth` Hook Created:**
    *   Created a dedicated authentication hook `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to encapsulate all login/logout logic and user state management, improving separation of concerns.
    *   Migrated NIP-07 and NIP-46 login flows (including status tracking, QR code URL handling, and error management) from `src/App.tsx` into the `useAuth` hook.
    *   Removed data persistence logic (IndexedDB interactions via `idb`) from the `useAuth` hook as per the user's request, simplifying it for the current app's needs.
    *   Corrected the NIP-46 initiation flow within `useAuth` by removing an incorrect `signer.connect()` call and ensuring the connection is implicitly triggered (e.g., via `signer.user()`).
    *   Resolved associated linter errors in `useAuth.ts` related to imports, types, and unused variables.
    *   The `useAuth` hook now provides a clean interface to the rest of the application, exposing the NDK instance, connection readiness, login status (`isLoggedIn`), current user (`currentUser`), relevant NIP-46 state (`nip46AuthUrl`, `nip46Status`), errors, and functions for initiating NIP-07/NIP-46 login and logging out.

3.  **Next Step:** The next logical step is to integrate the newly created `useAuth` hook into `src/App.tsx`, replacing the local state and logic that has been moved into the hook.
