1. Dependencies:
You'll primarily need @nostr-dev-kit/ndk and likely nostr-tools for utility functions like nip19 encoding/decoding and key generation.

npm install @nostr-dev-kit/ndk nostr-tools
# or
yarn add @nostr-dev-kit/ndk nostr-tools

2. NDK Singleton Instance (Prerequisite):
You need an initialized and preferably connected NDK instance available, created similarly to src/ndk.ts. This instance will be passed into the useAuth hook.
