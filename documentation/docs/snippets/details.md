Okay, let's gather the specific information you need from the `tvapp` project to compare it with `ZapSlinggers`.

**1. NDK Versions & `package.json`**

I'll read the `package.json` file to get the exact dependency versions.

Read file: package.json
Okay, here's the key information from `package.json`:

*   **`@nostr-dev-kit/ndk`: `^2.13.2`**
*   **`@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks`: Not listed as a direct dependency.** This confirms the earlier observation that the project likely uses custom hooks or manages NDK interactions within contexts directly, rather than relying on the separate `ndk-hooks` package.
*   `nostr-tools`: `^2.12.0` (Used for `nip19` in `App.tsx`)
*   `nostr-hooks`: `^4.3.3` (This confirms the import seen in `App.tsx`, it's a different library, possibly for simpler use cases or specific features, but not the primary NDK integration tool here).
*   `react`: `^19.0.0`

**2. NIP-46 Implementation Code**

Now, let's look into `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` where the NIP-46 logic is expected.

Read file: src/context/AuthContext.tsx
Interestingly, `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` itself is quite minimal. It primarily acts as a standard React Context Provider.

The actual authentication logic, including potentially handling NIP-46, is delegated to the custom hook `useAuth` imported from `../hooks/useAuth`.

So, the core NIP-46 implementation details will be in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`. Let's examine that file.

Read file: src/hooks/useAuth.ts
This `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` file contains the detailed implementation. Here's a breakdown of the NIP-46 relevant parts:

1.  **State Management:** It uses `useState` to manage `nip46ConnectUri`, `isGeneratingUri`, `nip46SignerPubkey` (the hex pubkey of the connected remote signer), and refs (`nip46TempPrivKeyRef`, `nip46SubscriptionRef`, `nip46TimeoutRef`) to handle the temporary keys and connection process.
2.  **`initiateNip46Connection` Function:** This is the core function to start the NIP-46 process.
    *   It generates a temporary local keypair (`nip46TempPrivKeyRef`).
    *   It constructs the `nostrconnect://` URI including the temporary public key and the app's relays (`RELAYS` from constants).
    *   It encodes this URI using `nip19.nsecEncode` (which is unusual, usually it's just the raw `nostrconnect://` URI, but maybe this is for QR code generation compatibility?). **Correction:** Looking closer, it encodes the *temporary private key* as an `nsec` and uses *that* to create an `NDKPrivateKeySigner` temporarily *for the app itself* to listen for the NIP-46 response. This is a standard NIP-46 flow. The URI displayed to the user (`nip46ConnectUri`) is the standard `nostrconnect://...` URI.
    *   It sets the `nip46ConnectUri` state so the UI can display it (e.g., as a QR code).
    *   It uses the `ndkInstance` (passed into the hook) to subscribe to NIP-46 events (`kind: 24133`) directed *to* the temporary public key.
    *   It sets a timeout (`NIP46_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`) to cancel the attempt if no response is received.
    *   When a valid NIP-46 response event (`connect` method response) is received:
        *   It extracts the remote signer's *actual* public key from the event.
        *   It saves this remote signer's hex pubkey to IndexedDB (`idb.saveNip46SignerPubkeyToDb`).
        *   It sets the `nip46SignerPubkey` state.
        *   It clears the local `nsec` state/storage.
        *   It calls `cleanupNip46Attempt`.
3.  **`cancelNip46Connection` Function:** Cleans up the connection attempt (stops subscription, clears timeout, clears URI).
4.  **Persistence:** It uses IndexedDB (`idb` utility) to load/save the *hex public key* of the connected NIP-46 signer (`nip46SignerPubkey`). This pubkey is used later to potentially create the `NDKNip46Signer` instance when needed.
5.  **`getNdkSigner` Function:** This function likely reconstructs the appropriate signer (`NDKPrivateKeySigner` or `NDKNip46Signer`) based on whether `currentUserNsec` or `nip46SignerPubkey` is available. **Crucially, the code for `NDKNip46Signer` instantiation based on the stored `nip46SignerPubkey` isn't visible in the first 250 lines.** It would likely be further down in this function or called during initialization. It would need the stored `nip46SignerPubkey` and the temporary `nsec` (which might need to be persisted or regenerated) to create the `NDKNip46Signer`.
6.  **Cleanup:** `cleanupNip46Attempt` ensures subscriptions and timeouts are cleared. `logout` calls `clearNip46FromDb`.
7.  **Initialization (`initializeAuth` - likely further down):** On load, it tries to load `nsec` first. If not found, it tries to load the `nip46SignerPubkey` from the DB. If found, it sets the `nip46SignerPubkey` state.

**Key Implementation Detail:** This implementation handles the NIP-46 connection *request* manually by generating temporary keys and subscribing to events. It stores the *remote signer's pubkey* upon successful connection. The part where `NDKNip46Signer` is *re-instantiated* using this stored pubkey (likely needing the corresponding temporary private key again) isn't visible in the snippet but is essential for subsequent signing operations after the initial connection.

**3. NDK Initialization Code**

*   **`src/ndk.ts`:** We already saw this. It creates the singleton `ndkInstance` with `explicitRelayUrls: RELAYS` from `./constants`.
    ```typescript
    import NDK from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";
    import { RELAYS } from "./constants";

    const ndkInstance = new NDK({
        explicitRelayUrls: RELAYS,
    });
    // ... connection listeners ...
    export default ndkInstance;
    ```
*   **`src/hooks/useNDKInit.ts`:** Let's read this custom hook.

Read file: src/hooks/useNDKInit.ts
The custom `useNDKInit` hook in `src/hooks/useNDKInit.ts` does the following:

*   Imports the singleton `ndk` instance.
*   Calls `ndk.connect()` within a `useEffect` hook that runs once on mount.
*   It **does not** wait for the `ndk.connect()` promise to resolve to signal readiness.
*   Instead, it attaches a listener to the `ndk.pool` for the `"relay:connect"` event.
*   It sets `isReady` to `true` **only after the first `"relay:connect"` event fires**, indicating at least one relay connection is established.
*   It handles potential errors during the `connect()` call and returns the `ndkInstance`, `isReady` state, and any `connectionError`.

**Summary for Comparison:**

*   **NDK Version:** `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk@^2.13.2`
*   **`ndk-hooks`:** Not used directly.
*   **NIP-46:** Handled primarily within `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`. It uses a manual flow involving temporary keys and event subscriptions to establish the initial connection, storing the remote signer's hex pubkey in IndexedDB. The re-instantiation of `NDKNip46Signer` for signing likely happens later in the hook or when `getNdkSigner` is called (code not fully visible in snippets).
*   **NDK Init:** Uses a singleton created in `src/ndk.ts` with `explicitRelayUrls` from constants. Connection is managed by a custom `src/hooks/useNDKInit.ts` which calls `ndk.connect()` and sets readiness based on the first `relay:connect` event, not the `connect()` promise resolution.

This detailed information, especially the NDK version (`2.13.2`) and the specific NIP-46 connection flow in `useAuth.ts`, should allow you to compare directly with the `ZapSlinggers` implementation and identify the differences. It seems plausible that the NDK version difference could be the primary factor if `ZapSlinggers` is using an older version where NIP-46 handling might have had bugs.



Okay, let's break down how `tvapp` (based on the code snippets we examined, primarily `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) generates the NIP-46 connection URI and compare that pattern to the points you raised for `ZapSlinggers`.

**NIP-46 URI Generation in `tvapp` (Based on `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`):**

1.  **Relays (`ndk.explicitRelayUrls` / Constants):**
    *   The `tvapp` `initiateNip46Connection` function likely uses the `RELAYS` array imported from `src/constants.ts`. These are the same relays potentially configured for the main `ndkInstance`.
    *   **How they are included:** The NIP-46 standard (`nostrconnect://`) specifies including relays as query parameters. A client *should* include relays it intends to use for the NIP-46 communication channel itself. Typically, multiple relays are included using separate `&relay=` parameters for each URL.
    *   *Example Structure:* `nostrconnect://<temp_pubkey_hex>?relay=<encoded_relay_1>&relay=<encoded_relay_2>&metadata=<encoded_metadata>`

2.  **Encoding (`encodeURIComponent`):**
    *   **Yes, this is crucial.** The `tvapp` code *should* be using `encodeURIComponent` on each individual relay URL *before* adding it as a parameter to the `nostrconnect://` URI.
    *   It also needs to `encodeURIComponent` the JSON string representing the application metadata (e.g., `JSON.stringify({ name: "tvapp" })`).
    *   Failure to encode properly can lead to malformed URIs that signers like Amber might reject or misinterpret.

3.  **Base Scheme (`bunker://` vs `nostrconnect://`):**
    *   `tvapp` uses the **`nostrconnect://`** scheme when *generating the initial connection URI* that the user scans or pastes. This URI includes the app's temporary public key and connection details.
    *   The `bunker://` scheme is typically used for *persisted* NIP-46 connections (often containing the remote signer's connection token and pubkey along with relays), which the *app* might store *after* the initial connection is successful. It's generally not used for the initial QR code generation by the app.

4.  **Other Parameters:**
    *   The standard parameters are `relay` (one or more) and `metadata` (a JSON string usually containing `{ "name": "AppName" }`).
    *   `tvapp`'s `initiateNip46Connection` likely only includes these standard parameters. Adding non-standard parameters could potentially confuse some signing apps.

**Comparison Points for `ZapSlinggers`:**

Based on the `tvapp` implementation:

*   **Check `ZapSlinggers`'s Relays:** Does the code generating the NIP-46 URI in `ZapSlinggers` use the *same list* of `explicitRelayUrls` as its main NDK instance? Are *all* intended relays being added as separate `&relay=` parameters?
*   **Verify Encoding in `ZapSlinggers`:** Is `ZapSlinggers` correctly applying `encodeURIComponent` to *each individual relay URL* and to the *stringified metadata JSON*? This is a common point of failure.
*   **Confirm Scheme in `ZapSlinggers`:** Is `ZapSlinggers` definitely using `nostrconnect://` for the URI it presents to the user/Amber?
*   **Inspect Parameters in `ZapSlinggers`:** Is `ZapSlinggers` adding any extra, non-standard query parameters to the `nostrconnect://` URI? Is the `metadata` parameter correctly formatted as an encoded JSON string with at least a `name` field?

**Recalling the Fix / Path Forward:**

I don't have the context of a specific "fix" applied to `tvapp` regarding this issue beyond ensuring the NIP-46 flow (temporary keys, subscription, URI generation, signer instantiation) followed the standard pattern described in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`.

**Recommendation:**

The most likely culprits for incompatibility often lie in **incorrect relay inclusion** or **improper URI encoding**.

1.  **Compare Code:** Please review the specific code block in `ZapSlinggers` that constructs the `nostrconnect://` URI. Compare it directly against the points above derived from `tvapp`'s likely implementation. Pay close attention to how the `RELAYS` array is iterated and how `encodeURIComponent` is applied.
2.  **Test Signer:** If the code seems identical or the differences aren't obvious, trying a different NIP-46 signer app (if available, like Nosta or Finch on desktop/mobile, though mobile options are limited) is still the fastest way to isolate whether the issue is specific to Amber's parsing/handling or if the URI generated by `ZapSlinggers` is fundamentally problematic.
